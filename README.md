Throughout this course, I encountered a variety of challenges and solved numerous problems that helped me grow as a programmer. The key areas of focus included identifying and applying abstract data types (such as Lists, Stacks, Queues, Graphs, Trees, Heaps, Hash Tables, and B-Trees) and creating various types of algorithms, including recursive, searching, inserting, removing, traversing, and greedy algorithms. I also worked with sorting algorithms such as insertion, selection, shell, quicksort, merge, radix, and fast sorting. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of function complexity analysis and best practices for debugging, resizing, and using libraries.

Main Project Problems: Project One: The first project required me to expand pseudocode to meet the requirements of ABCU, which involved printing a list of all the Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order and displaying a course's title and prerequisites.

Approach to the Problem: I began by writing pseudocode to align with each requirement. After developing the pseudocode, I evaluated the run-time and memory usage for each data structure used. Based on this analysis, I was able to recommend the most appropriate data structure for the final project.

Overcoming Roadblocks: One of the main challenges I faced was evaluating the run-time and memory usage of each data structure. Initially, I struggled to recall how to properly calculate run-times. However, by doing some research, I refreshed my understanding and successfully completed the assignment. Additionally, analyzing my pseudocode to evaluate run-times helped me improve the quality and efficiency of my code.

Project Two: For the second project, I moved forward by writing the final code based on the requirements from ABCU.

Approach to the Problem: I began by reviewing all customer requirements, previous assignments, and resources provided for the project. I then used a hash table sample code I had previously created as a template to begin developing the final code. After that, I modified the code to meet the new customer requirements and to fit the data provided by ABCU.

Overcoming Roadblocks: Writing the code to input, store, and utilize the data provided by ABCU was relatively straightforward, but there were several challenges in ensuring the format matched ABCU's specifications. This required a significant amount of time spent on debugging, testing, and revising the code to ensure it met the necessary standards.

Reflection and Growth: These projects significantly expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs. I gained a deep understanding of various abstract data types and learned how to apply them in different contexts. I also developed the ability to write a wide range of algorithms, each tailored to specific data structures. By learning about the strengths and weaknesses of each data type and algorithm, I now have a better sense of which ones to choose based on the requirements of a program and the available system resources. This knowledge has enabled me to write more efficient and effective code.

The projects also improved my ability to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. I now have a clearer understanding of how to collect project requirements, choose the best algorithms and data structures, write pseudocode, analyze run-time complexities, debug effectively, and produce well-organized, concise code. While these practices are applicable across all programming languages, this course has given me valuable experience with C++ specifically, which I plan to carry forward in my future projects.
